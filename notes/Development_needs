Here is what I see as some of the remaining issues to get a first diurnal benchmarking paper out focused on CLM/ELM (maybe FATES) site level runs:

* How to define the growing season/dormant season to apply to all variables so we can better benchmark/score some of th variables like sensible heat which has a stron annual cycle

* How to deal with messy AMF data and missing variables.  Can we come up with a way to calculate missing variables?

* What are the expected errors in AMF data, do we need to account for this in scoring?

* Can we add the diurnal functional benchmarks or use existing at the diurnal scale

* Model parameterization/spin-up:  Probably good on this, just want to be sure I run it by CLM folks.

* What AMF sites - related to 2
